# How to build the project
You must always deploy the compiled JavaScript on your production server. You can create the production build by running the following command.<br>
<code>node ace build --production</code> <br>
The compiled output is written to the build folder. You can cd into this folder and start the server by directly running the server.js file. <br>
<code>
cd build <br>
node server.js
</code> <br>
